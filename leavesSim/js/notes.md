// Did I need to calculate velocities of a leaf for this to look realistic? No.
// Did I want to? Yes, It was fun!

// We will go with 5220 kg/mÂ³
// We assume mass of leaf is 0.005kg.
// We assume the cross sectional area of a leaf is 0.58m^2

// Cd = ((2)*(0.005)*(9.81))/((1.204)*0.58*Math.pow(0.254, 2))
// Cd = 2.1774444969442124 = 2.177
// This gets us to the equation for velocity.
